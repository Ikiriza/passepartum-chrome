<p>\
Your login data is stored <b>locally</b> and <b>unencrypted</b> somewhere in the files \
for this Chrome extension. This means anybody with access to this computer can potentially \
access your password, even if that access is a remote one (Team Viewer or potential spyware). \
It is not synchronized so it stays localized which means that it cannot be scooped \
by somebody watching your network traffic or something similar. \
<br>\
Why do we compare the security to that of the chrome/edge password autofill feature? \
Because if someone would go to the login page of moodle and your passwords gets autofilled, \
it is a matter of a few clicks to copy the password out of the password window \
(change "type" of the field in the html code). \
<br>\
Personally, I (Jonathan) am using my own extension (I initially only wrote it for myself), so I think it \
is probably fine to use, but I am not studying information security or anything close to that so I \
might be wrong. \
<br>\
You can use this extension even without providing your TUM login. It will still save you one or \
two click here and there - that is the whole point after all. \
